# PRD: Thevenin Simulation Engine

## Introduction

Build a SPICE circuit simulation engine in Rust as a library crate (`thevenin`). This is a ground-up rewrite of ngspice's simulation core, using the existing `thevenin-types` crate for parsing. The engine must produce identical numerical results to ngspice for all supported analyses.

**The project is done when thevenin passes the entire ngspice base test suite** (113 `.cir` tests in `ngspice-upstream/tests/`). The test suite includes resistance circuits, filters, transient analysis, device models (BJT, MOSFET, JFET, MESFET, transmission lines), pole-zero analysis, sensitivity analysis, and regression tests.

This is a **library-first** project. Thevenin is shipped as a Rust crate for embedding in other tools. A CLI may be added for convenience and test-running, but the public API surface is the library.

## Goals

- Implement Modified Nodal Analysis (MNA) matrix assembly and solving
- Support all core SPICE analyses: `.op`, `.dc`, `.tran`, `.ac`, `.noise`, `.tf`, `.sens`, `.pz`
- Implement device models: R, C, L, V, I, D, Q (BJT), M (MOSFET), J (JFET), transmission lines
- Pass all 113 ngspice base test suite `.cir` files with output matching `.out` reference files
- Expose a clean, idiomatic Rust library API
- Test-driven: port ngspice test cases as Rust integration tests before implementing features

## User Stories

- [ ] CLI is a thin wrapper around the library — all logic lives in library crates

- [ ] `cargo test --workspace` passes

## Functional Requirements

- FR-1: Library crate `thevenin` exposes `simulate(netlist: &Netlist) -> Result<SimResult>` as the primary API
- FR-2: All analysis types (`.op`, `.dc`, `.tran`, `.ac`, `.noise`, `.tf`, `.sens`, `.pz`) are supported
- FR-3: All linear devices (R, C, L, V, I, E, F, G, H, K) have correct MNA stamps
- FR-4: All nonlinear devices (D, Q, M, J) use Newton-Raphson with companion models
- FR-5: Subcircuit expansion handles nesting, parameter passing, and port mapping
- FR-6: Transient analysis supports BE and trapezoidal integration with adaptive timestep
- FR-7: AC analysis builds complex MNA matrix and sweeps frequency
- FR-8: Output format for CLI matches ngspice batch mode (for test suite compatibility)
- FR-9: Numerical results match ngspice within tolerances used by `check.sh` diff comparison
- FR-10: `.model` and `.param` directives are fully supported

## Non-Goals (Out of Scope)

- XSpice mixed-signal / code models (digital gates, state machines, etc.)
- Interactive mode / control language (`.control` / `.endc` blocks)
- GUI or plotting
- OSDI device model loading
- Shared library / C FFI interface
- BSIM-CMG (FinFET) or other bleeding-edge models not in the base test suite
- Monte Carlo / statistical analysis
- Parallel / multi-threaded simulation

## Technical Considerations

- **Workspace structure:** Split into subcrates along natural boundaries:
  - `thevenin-types` — parser (already exists)
  - `thevenin` — sparse matrix, MNA assembly, solver infrastructure
  - `thevenin-devices` — device model implementations (stamps, companion models)
  - `thevenin` — top-level library tying it together + CLI binary
- **Linear algebra:** Use `faer` or similar pure-Rust sparse solver. Avoid C dependencies.
- **Device model trait:** Define a `Device` trait with methods for DC stamp, AC stamp, transient stamp, noise contribution. Each device type implements this trait.
- **Test infrastructure:** Build a test harness that can load `.cir`/`.out` pairs from ngspice-upstream and run them as Rust integration tests.
- **Reference code:** ngspice C source in `ngspice-upstream/` is the authoritative reference for equations, convergence algorithms, and expected behavior.

## Success Metrics

- **All 113 ngspice base test suite `.cir` files produce output matching their `.out` reference files** using the same filtering and comparison rules as ngspice's `check.sh`
- Library API is ergonomic: simulate a circuit in < 10 lines of Rust
- No `unsafe` code outside of clearly justified performance-critical sections
- Zero `serde` or `syn` dependencies — use `facet` and `unsynn`

## Open Questions

- Should we support `.control` blocks for the regression tests that use self-validating control scripts, or rewrite those as native Rust assertions?
- Which BSIM3/4 variant parameters are actually exercised by the test suite? (May be able to implement a subset)
- Should temperature-dependent parameters (`.temp`, TC1/TC2) be in Phase 1 or deferred?
- Mutual inductance (K element) — needed for any base tests? If not, defer.
