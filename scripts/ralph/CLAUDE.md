# Ralph Agent Instructions — Thevenin

You are an autonomous coding agent working on **thevenin**, a Rust rewrite of ngspice (circuit simulator). This is a **library-first** project.

## Project Context

- **Reference C source:** `ngspice-upstream/` (read-only, do not modify)
- **Existing netlist parser:** `thevenin-types/` crate (parses SPICE files)
- **Project root CLAUDE.md:** Read `../../CLAUDE.md` for conventions, goals, and dev methodology
- **Test suite:** `ngspice-upstream/tests/` contains 113 `.cir`/`.out` test pairs — the project is done when all pass

## Quality Checks

**Always run commands through `nix develop --command ...`** so that flake.nix stays honest.

```bash
nix develop --command cargo clippy --workspace -- -D warnings
nix develop --command cargo nextest run --workspace
nix develop --command cargo fmt --check
```

If a command fails because a tool is missing, add it to the `devShell` in `flake.nix`.

## Key Rules

- **Correctness over performance.** Get it right first. Optimize later.
- **Make impossible states irrepresentable.** Use enums, newtypes, typestate.
- **Use facet, not serde.** Use unsynn, not syn.
- **Split into subcrates freely.** Don't let things get monolithic.
- **Test-driven.** Write tests first when possible. Port ngspice tests before implementing.
- **Never include Co-Authored-By lines in git commits.**
- **Library-first.** All simulation logic lives in library crates. CLI is a thin wrapper.

## Your Task — Choose a Pass Type

Each iteration, you choose ONE of three pass types based on what's most valuable right now.

### Pass Types

| Pass | When to choose it |
|------|-------------------|
| **implementation** | Default. There are stories to implement and the codebase is in good shape to receive new work. |
| **project-management** | The PRD needs attention: stories are too large, priorities are wrong, acceptance criteria are stale, or there are gaps in the plan. |
| **architecture** | Tech debt is accumulating, code is duplicated across device models, modules are too large, or upcoming stories would benefit from refactoring first. |

### How to Choose

1. Read the PRD at `prd.json`
2. Read the progress log at `progress.txt` (check Codebase Patterns section first)
3. Read `../../CLAUDE.md` for project conventions
4. Review the **pass history** below (injected by ralph.sh)
5. Consider:
   - **If the last 4+ passes were all implementation** → strongly consider a PM or architecture pass
   - **If you notice the next story is unclear, too large, or has stale criteria** → do a PM pass
   - **If you notice duplicated patterns, overgrown files, or tech debt** → do an architecture pass
   - **If the codebase is clean and the next story is clear** → do an implementation pass
   - **Never do the same non-implementation pass type twice in a row**

6. Once you've decided, read the detailed instructions for your chosen pass type from the `passes/` directory:
   - `passes/implementation.md`
   - `passes/project-management.md`
   - `passes/architecture.md`

7. Follow those instructions completely.

### Pass History

<!-- PASS_HISTORY_PLACEHOLDER -->

## Logging Your Pass

After completing your work, you MUST update the `passLog` array in `prd.json` by appending an entry:

```json
{
  "iteration": <next number>,
  "passType": "implementation" | "project-management" | "architecture",
  "summary": "Brief description of what was done",
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "storyId": "US-XXX or null if not an implementation pass"
}
```

## Stop Condition

After completing a pass, check if ALL stories have `passes: true`.

If ALL stories are complete and passing, reply with:
<promise>COMPLETE</promise>

If there are still stories with `passes: false`, end your response normally (another iteration will pick up the next task).

## Important

- Do ONE pass per iteration
- Commit frequently
- **Always push after committing** (`git push`)
- Keep CI green
- Read the Codebase Patterns section in progress.txt before starting
- Reference ngspice C source in `ngspice-upstream/` when implementing algorithms
